# Employee Turnover Analysis

![Employee Turnover Image](pexels-sora-shimazaki-5673488.jpg)

## Overview

This project aims to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and build a predictive model for employee turnover. We explore the factors contributing to employee turnover and develop a predictive model to identify potential attrition risks.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing** (data_preprocessing.ipynb)
  - Obtain the employee turnover dataset.
  - Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and outliers.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** (eda.ipynb)
  - Generate summary statistics, visualizations, and distributions of key variables.
  - Explore relationships between features and turnover.
  - Identify potential patterns and trends.

- **Feature Engineering** (feature_engineering.ipynb)
  - Create new features if relevant, e.g., length of employment, age groups, department-wise turnover rates.
  - Encode categorical variables if needed.

- **Statistical Tests** (statistical_tests.ipynb)
  - Conduct hypothesis tests (t-tests, chi-squared tests, etc.) to determine statistically significant differences between groups (e.g., turnover by gender or department).

- **Predictive Modeling** (predictive_modeling.ipynb)
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
  - Build and evaluate predictive models using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.
  - Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves.
  - Tune hyperparameters and select the best-performing model.

- **Interpretability** (interpretability.ipynb)
  - Use feature importance techniques to explain the model's predictions.
  - Visualize decision trees or SHAP values to understand variable impact.

- **Recommendations and Insights** (insights.md)
  - Provide actionable insights for HR or management based on the analysis.
  - Offer suggestions to reduce employee turnover.

- **Data** (data/)
  - Directory containing the dataset used in the analysis.

- **Models** (models/)
  - Directory to store trained machine learning models (if applicable).
